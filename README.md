# MBP

Minimal Blogging Platform is a Blogging tool built off of PHP. It uses Git as it's user authentication where in the owner of the blog is to make a repository in the storage to add posts. The posts are written as markdown files within the posts folder. MBP then parses that folder to populate the posts and individual post page. It has no commenting capibilties, DB, editor, or admin panel to speak of. But it manages posts effeciantly for someone who knows git and markdown.
